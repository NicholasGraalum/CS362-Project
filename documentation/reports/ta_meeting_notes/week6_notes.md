- For testing make sure we hit each type of test at least once (look at lecture 5 for defs):  
-- Unit testing  
-- integration testing  
-- Validation testing    
-- System Testing

- each person needs to implement at least 2 tests (double check that with whats written in ruberic)  
-- can be on what we implemented (for simplicity)  

- Next friday Ta meeting will be a demo, so we should have a fully functional product (prof might attend)
