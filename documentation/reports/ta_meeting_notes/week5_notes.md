#### Architecture and design doc and presentation:
- Add detail to design (include more specific libraries and dependencies such as npm to start local host)
- Specifically follow the rubric (we missed a few aspects)
The slideshow presentation should also follow the rubric, take information off the living doc. 
- Ta said we should follow the rubric exactly for the presentation, but it's still unclear if the rubric is for grading the doc or the presentation. So I think we should also include everything described in the presentation description.

#### Team organization
- Start using trello for individual tasks (Everything you do should be documented as a task on trello, even if you are adding it after the fact)
- Start doing individual commits instead of group commits on github (we should probably retire the google doc and just edit the markdown directly from now on)

#### Other
- Remove a use case to match number of active team members.
