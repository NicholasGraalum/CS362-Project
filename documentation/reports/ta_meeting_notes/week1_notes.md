- Need to assign front end and back end testers (each person can be software developer/tester)

- Turn our major features into use cases
- Each use case should be its own little story(ish) as described on the assignment doc link
- Each person on our team should make their own use case (those are the features they will be implementing)

- Expand on our abstract so it summarizes all major features and use cases. 

- Fix our timeline to match the one described by the class outline in canvas (we donâ€™t have to, but it's probably best to)
