### Week 6:
#### Overview:
We worked on our initial implementation of our frontend webpages and server. The server is setup on local host and is connected to a local database. We realized the project architecture we described last week is very close to model/view/controller and decided to organize our filestructure in the standard model/view/controller way.  
We plan to finish our main use cases later this week and test the implementation.
