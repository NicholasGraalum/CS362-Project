### Abstract
Consider the choices of meal preparation, costs of meals and where to shop for groceries. With this we have decided to go ahead with developing a Smart Grocery List Generator. An app that creates grocery lists based on meal plans and dynamically adjusts based on user preferences and budget constraints. Users will be able to search for meals or get recommendations of meals from a database of meals entered by other users. This app is perfect for those who need extra help organizing and planning their week ahead. 
### Goal
Our team goal is to develop a Smart Grocery List Generator that will help with creating grocery lists based on meal plans. Our web based application will generate the list based on the users preferences and budget.
